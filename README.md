# M.a.r.s. - Manuals and Records System

Mars is a cloud-hybrid, mobile-ready, file-storage system.

  - Store User manuals and guides
  - Find the information when you need it
  - Reduce the paper clutter


## Tech

Mars uses a few projects to work properly:

* [Slim] - A micro php framework!
* [MongoDb Atlas] - A hosted mongodb platform.  


And M.A.R.S. is a work in progress the source  code is at a [repository][repo]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

### Docker
```
Mars is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.
